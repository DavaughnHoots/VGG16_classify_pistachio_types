# VGG16 Classification of Pistachio Types

This repository contains the implementation and results for our paper "Using VGG16 to classify Pistachio types" which achieves state-of-the-art results of 99.23% ± 0.11% accuracy on the Pistachio Image Dataset.

## Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of VGG16 with transfer learning for binary classification of pistachio varieties (Kirmizi and Siirt). Through rigorous statistical validation across 5 independent experimental runs, our implementation achieves 99.23% ± 0.11% accuracy (95% CI: [99.10%, 99.36%]).
